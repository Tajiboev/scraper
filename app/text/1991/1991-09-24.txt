Reason:           The collimator trays can be pulled free of the stackers 
                  because of a weakness in the end stops on the shelf

Manufacturer:     Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Anasco, Puerto Rico. 
Recalled by:      Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Irvine, California, by 
                  letter April 24, 1991.  Firm-initiated recall complete. 
Distribution:     Nationwide and international. 
Quantity:         10,338 units were distributed.
Reason:           Defective gasket assembly and lack of bond integrity can
                  cause leakage, resulting in decreased oxygenation and 
                  carbon dioxide removal.

Manufacturer:     George Tremann & Company, Plainview, New York.
Recalled by:      Techmedica, Inc., Camarillo, California, by telephone

Distribution:     Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon, Washington state, Virginia,
                  Louisiana, South Africa, Korea, Australia, Canada.
Quantity:         24 units were distributed.
Reason:           One of the dimensional measurements was incorrectly 
                  measured.  The 1.857 measurement for the distance to
                  the first placement of the calibrated groove is to
                  be measured from .060" from the tip.  Instead it was
                  measured from the tip of the depth gauge causing the
                  7 calibrated grooves to be .060" off.

                  recall ongoing. 
Distribution:     Indiana, Ohio.
Quantity:         5 units were distributed. 
Reason:           The product is incorrectly labeled as "TIB INS #2/14 .5 mm" 
                  whereas it should be labeled as "TIB INS #8-18mm."

Distribution:     Nationwide. 
Quantity:         17 units were distributed.
Reason:           The time delay may not be within specifications.  The 
                  length of delay is intended by the firm to be 30 (ms) 
                  to 50 (ms) with the upper limit of the delay specified

                                     -13- 





Reason:           The gamma radiation used in sterilization causes shrinkage
                  of the UHMWPE liner which can result in a poor fit between
                  the UHMWPE liner and the metal shell.
