Reason:           The gastrostomy tube bumper, which is implanted to the
                  inside of the gastric wall, and serves as the connection for
                  the feeding tube, may be pulled through the gastric wall, 
                  allowing the stomach to fall away from the anterior 
                  abdominal wall.  This separation can go undetected, allowing
                  the food to enter peritoneal cavity.
