Reason:           The product may not meet its labeled performance
                  specifications.  This may cause lower than expected 
                  blank absorbence which generates DRR (dynamic range 
                  reduced) flags and prevents successful loading of the 
                  reagent cartridge, and inability to maintain quality
                  control for the reagent within expected ranges.
