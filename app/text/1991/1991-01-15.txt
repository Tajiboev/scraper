Distribution:     Nationwide and international. 
Quantity:         Approximately 25,000 units were distributed.
Reason:           The Proplast/Teflon material is not substantially 
                  equivalent to Silastic.  TMJ IPI's made from this 
                  material may fragment, delaminate or otherwise be damaged 
                  or punctured in a load-bearing position.  Debris in the 
                  joint from the implants can contribute to progressive bone
                  degeneration of the condyle of the mandible and/or glenoid
                  fossa and to foreign body response which could start in 
                  this area and be carried throughout the immune system.

                  recall ongoing. 
Distribution:     Nationwide and international. 
Quantity:         7,008 units were distributed. 
Reason:           Intermittent changes in electrical characteristics of 
                  either the volume or breathing effort control components
                  may result in the device delivering tidal volumes above or
                  below the control setting.  Under certain conditions, the 
                  units may delay or fail to provide an audible/visual high 
                  or low pressure alarm.  In addition, a liquid spill entry 
                  into the device may cause the device to fail to cycle or
                  alarm, cause motor stalls, volume fluctuations, or other

Manufacturer:     Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Recalled by:      Manufacturer, by letter November 3, 1989.  Firm-initiated 
                  recall complete.
Distribution:     Nationwide and international.

Reason:           Lypholized tracers did not go into solution.  Incompletely
                  dissolved AFP tracers could cause poor replication of 
                  intravial variability and consequently inaccurate test
                  results.
