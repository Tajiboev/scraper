Distribution:     Nationwide and international.

Reason:           The heating unit may not turn off.  The unit may behave 
                  as if the touch switch was permanently engaged.  The
                  problem appears to have been caused by a bad phenloic

Reason:           Lots 8J-020-04 and 8K-006-04 may contain defective roller 
                  clamps which may break during use, resulting in interrupted 
                  or unrestricted flow of solution through the tubing; and
                  lot 9B-006-04X may have loosened needle adaptor protectors,

Quantity:         16 units were distributed.
Reason:           Noncompliance with performance standards for x-ray

                  the image receptor without changing the aperture. 
                  This may result in the x-ray field not being aligned
                  properly with the image receptor.
