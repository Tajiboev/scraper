RECALLS AND FIELD CORRECTIONS: FOODS -- CLASS I
_______________________________
RECALL NUMBER, PRODUCT AND CODE:
F-467-1, Sci-Fit Tri-Cuts Dietary Supplement Capsules sold in 90 and 180 count 
bottles.  The product contains 1000 mcg of tiratricol (100 mg of Tricol).  The 
product is sold 12 bottles per case.  The product label states �Formulated and 
Distributed by: Sci-Fit, 140 Pennsylvania Avenue, Oakmont, PA�.  The firm recalled 
all codes of the product on the market at the time the recall was initiated.

The product contained tiratricol (also known as triiodothyroacetic acid or 
TRIAC), an active thyroid hormone.  The product�s label recommends to not exceed 
three capsules daily.  This dose is in excess of the usual replacement dose of 
thyroid hormone and therefore would cause hyperthyroidism. Particularly in 
patients with underlying cardiac disease, this poses a significant health risk 
because of immediate, life-threatening consequences as heart attack, stroke, 
heart failure and arrhythmia.
