FDA 
Enforcement Report
The FDA Enforcement Report is published weekly by the Food and
Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services. 
It contains information on actions  taken in connection with agency
Regulatory activities.




October 31, 2001                                           01-43



***CORRECTION*** Recall F-002-2 (Reported in Enforcement Report 
01-41 dated 10/17/01) and F-026-1 (Reported in Enforcement Report 01-42 
dated 10/24/01) was completed recall from an inspection and analysis by 
the New York State Department Agriculture and Markets.

***CORRECTION***The D-316-1 recall as reported in Enforcement Report #01-
41, dated 10/17/01, was incorrectly reported as being manufactured by PL 
Developments.  PL Developments was the repacker/ recalling firm and PDK 
Labs of Hauppauge, NY was the manufacturer of the bulk tablets.
