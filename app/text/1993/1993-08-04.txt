               commerce adulterated orange juice, and defrauding buyers by
               fraudulent pretenses.  The orange juice was adulterated by
               substitution of beet sugar and syrup for part of the orange
               juice and orange juice concentrate.  Citric acid and amino
               acids were also added to the juice to conceal damage and
               inferiority, and a preservative was added.  Mr. Wagoner was
               sentenced to 60 months in prison, a $100,000 fine, 2 years
               on supervised release after his prison term, and a special
               assessment of $50.

               charging the company with causing the adulteration of
               quinidine gluconate, a prescription heart medication.  The

               to a $2.5 million fine.
