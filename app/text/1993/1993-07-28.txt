DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide.
QUANTITY       14,170 units were distributed.

MANUFACTURER   ADAC Laboratories, Milpitas, California.
RECALLED BY    Manufacturer, by visit beginning June 1, 1992, and by
               telephone June 1, 1992.  Firm-initiated field correction
               ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide, Europe, Indonesia, China.
QUANTITY       317 units.
REASON         Wear occurs in the older Genesys Gamma Camera's ACME head
               screw assemblies resulting in reduced friction. If the loss
               of friction is significant and mechanical failure occurs at
               a point that disengages the germotor which drives the
               detector in and out, the detector could then coast downward
               with gravity.

QUANTITY       298 units.
REASON         A problem exists within the radius drive mechanism of the
               camera.  A drive shaft of one unit broke and could have
               fallen and hit a patient.  It was determined that the lack
               of lubrication of bearings caused a mechanical failure which
               caused the bolts, securing the camera's detector, to weaken
               and break under extreme load.

QUANTITY       3,882 kits were distributed; firm estimates none remains on
               the market.
REASON         Testing commercial control recoveries of this product ran
               higher than the firm's specification.  This causes a
               potential for inaccurate TSH test results.

REASON         The product was mislabeled with values of 0.11 + or - 0.6
               uIU/ml.  The correct value should have been 0.11 + or - 0.06

               Firm-initiated recall complete.

REASON         B-12 values were 15/20% low in the deficient and

REASON         The 0.25 ng/dl standard value of certain lots was

               may result in inaccurate test results.
