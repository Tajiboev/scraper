CRIMINAL INDICTMENT:
======================================================

AGAINST        Baldev Raj Bhutani, Neelam Bhutani, and Alra                 
               Laboratories, Inc., Gurnee, Illinois.
CHARGES        In a five-count Indictment, the defendants were              
               charged with having caused, with intent to defraud           
               and mislead, a label to be affixed to Lactulose              
               Syrup USP, which was false and misleading.  The              
               defendants were also charged with having                     
               caused the adulteration, with intent to defraud and          
               mislead, of Lactulose Syrup USP, in that:  the               
               product consisted in part of a decomposed substance;         
               the product had not been manufactured in accordance          
               with Good Manufacturing Practices; and, the                  
               manufacturing procedures for this drug product had           
               been materially altered by adding an undocumented            
               substance, Sodium Hydroxide, more than two years             
               after the original manufacture.  The defendants,             
               with intent to defraud and mislead, failed to                
               establish and maintain accurate manufacturing batch          
               production records for  the Lactulose Syrup, in that         
               they materially altered the manufacturing procedures for     
               his product by causing Sodium Hydroxide to be added to this  
               product more than two years after its original manufacture   
               but, in order to conceal this unauthorized procedure from    
               the FDA, failed to document this unapproved manufacturing    
               procedure in the production  batch records.  The defendants  
               were charged with having caused, with intent to defraud and  
               mislead, the introduction into interstate commerce for       
               delivery, of Lactulose Syrup which was misbranded.           
               The defendants were also charged with having caused,         
               with intent to defraud and mislead, the introduction         
               into interstate commerce for delivery, of                    
               Lactulose Syrup USP, which was adulterated.
