MANUFACTURER   Mallinckrodt medical, Athlone, Ireland.
RECALLED BY    Mallinckrodt, Inc., Chesterfield, Missouri, by
               letters issued on October 17 and 23, 1997.  
               Firm-initiated recall ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and Canada.
QUANTITY       Approximately 56,550 adapters were distributed.
REASON         The Carlens (Y) Adapter component may have a 
               small flap (flash) of excess plastic in one of 
               the ports where the smaller diameter tube joins
               the connector, which can partially occlude the
               inner diameter, causing some blockage of medical
               gas to occur.
