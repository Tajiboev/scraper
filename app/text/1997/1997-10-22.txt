  MANUFACTURER Medi-Ject Corporation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
  RECALLED BY  Manufacturer, by letter on September 25, 1997. 
               Firm-initiated recall ongoing.
  DISTRIBUTION Nationwide and international.
                               -7-
  QUANTITY     4,244 kits were distributed.
  REASON       Some of the disposable adapters in the kits
               fit too tightly to the Needle-free Syringe 
               and may result in the unintended removal or
               partial removal of the Needle-free Syringe
               from the power pack after filling.  The 
               second problem is that the Needle-free 
               Syringes in the kits may crack during use 
               resulting in a reduced dose of insulin to the
               patient.
