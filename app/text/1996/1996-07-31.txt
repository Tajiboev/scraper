PRODUCT        Allied Healthcare Bear Cub Infant Ventilator,

               pressure support of newborn and some pediatric
               patients.  Recall #Z-935-6.

RECALLED BY    Manufacturer, by letter dated May 21, 1996. 
               Firm-initiated recall ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       7,973 filters were distributed.

                             -8-REASON         Disconnection of the purge line filter could
               result in an undetected high airway pressure
               caused by a combination of filter
               disconnection and occlusion of the proximal
               pressure line.  Further, disconnection of the
               PEEP/Pressure limit valve assembly filter
               would stop flow of positive pressure gas.  In
               addition, replacement filters shipped as part
               of the firm's primary recall effort, were
               subsequently found to have been improperly
               welded.  These replacement filters can
               separate during use, with the same adverse
               effects as for the aforementioned filter
               disconnections.

               certain infrequent circumstances on
               instruments using Quantum IV software, sample
               detection system may be compromised leading to
               an incorrect, low result for one or more CX3
               or ISE chemistries.
