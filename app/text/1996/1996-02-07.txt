               3.0 liters at 25 - 30 breaths per minute,
               regardless of set parameters, and without

               condition, the fluoroscopy foot switch would
               not respond; however, the x-ray control would
               incorrectly indicate that radiation is present
               resulting in the x-ray unit to be noncompliant
               with 21 CFR 1020.32(c).

               F5L225, F5L231.  The lot number is interpreted
               as follows:  F = Puerto Rico; 5 = 1995; Alpha
               Character = month e.g. D = April, E = May
               etc.; last 3 digits are sequential production
               without regard to product produced.
