MANUFACTURER   Eastman Kodak Company, Windsor, Colorado.
RECALLED BY    Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, New York, by
               E-mail dated June 7 and 20, 1996, by letters
               of June 11 and 14, 1996.  Firm-initiated
               recall ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       55,729 boxes were distributed.
REASON         The firm's internal product testing revealed a
               small quantity of the subject products could
               exhibit a series of plus density artifacts in
               the form of round spots and straight lines due
               to static discharge in the manufacturing
               process.  There is a possibility that these
               artifacts could necessitate a repeat of a
               patient exposure.
