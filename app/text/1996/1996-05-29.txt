               in U.S.); (d) A2008E Dialysis System (model
               2008E); (e) 3008/FDS08 Dialysis System (model
               2008H).  Safety Alert #N-015/019-6.
CODE           All serial numbers.
MANUFACTURER   Fresenius USA, Inc., Walnut Creek, California.
ALERTED BY     Manufacturer, by letter dated December 26,
               1995.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       Approximately 25,000 units were distributed.
REASON         The heaters have been found to have pit
               corrosion problems, resulting in cracks
               sufficient to cause the ground fault
               interrupter (GFI) to trip. This may be due to
               bleach used to clean the machine when it is
               not always sufficiently rinsed out after use.
