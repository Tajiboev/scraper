               that they are cholesterol free, and fail to provide complete
               nutritional information as required.  All of the products
               lack words, statements, and other information required
               (i.e., the ingredients statement and location of the
               manufacturer) because they are not prominently placed
               thereon with such conspicuousness as to render them likely
               to be read by the ordinary individual under customary
               conditions of purchase, since the letters are less than 1/16
               inch in height.  Some of the products are foods for which a
               standard of identity has been established (angel hair,
               fettuccine, and linguine), and their labels fail to bear the
               name of the food specified in the regulation.  All of the
               products are fabricated from two or more ingredients and
               their labels fail to list the ingredients in descending
               order of predominance.

PRODUCT        "Irish Style" Oatmeal (92-613-410).
CHARGE         Misbranded - The product label falsely represents and
               suggests that the article is a "high fiber cereal," low in
               calories, and contains no cholesterol.  The product label
               fails to include the street address of the distributor;
               the net quantity of contents does not appear on the package
               in conspicuous type in distinct contrast with other matter
               on the package, and the statement of net quantity of
               contents on the package does not contain letters or numerals
               in a type size established by regulation in relationship to
               the area of the principal display panel of the package.

PRODUCT        Lemon strips (92-664-531).
CHARGE         Adulterated - The product contains cyclamate salt, an unsafe
               food additive, in that there is no regulation in effect
               describing the conditions under which it may be safely used.
               In addition, the product contains saccharin salt, a food
               additive which is unsafe because its use is not in
               conformance with the regulation which prescribes the
               conditions under which it may be safely used.
               Misbranded - The product is misbranded because:  it is
               offered for sale under the name of another food since it is
               contained in cases labeled as soup mix base; the label fails
               to bear the common or usual name of the food; it is
               fabricated from two or more ingredients and its label fails
               to declare the presence of saccharin or cyclamate; and, the
               product contains saccharin and the label fails to bear the
               required saccharin warning statement.
