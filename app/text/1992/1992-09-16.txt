ALERTED BY     Manufacturer, by letter February 10, 1992.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       19,300 units were distributed.
REASON         It came to the firm's attention that some customers used the     
               devices by removing the inflation bulb which is sold with the    
               device and by connecting the pressure infusor to a compressed    
               air line at the facility.  The firm advised users they should    
               discontinue use of this method because the infusor may balloon   
               to the point of failure resulting in complete rupture of the     
               infusor's bladder.
