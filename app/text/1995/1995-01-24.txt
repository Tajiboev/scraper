               1995, followed by visit.  Firm-initiated field
               correction ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       (a) 259 units; (b) 554 units; (c) 153 units
               were distributed;
REASON         The system may fail because of the following
               component failures:
               Power Supply:  Failure of a zener diode,
               designated at VR9 in the system power supply,
               which can result in a "Power On" condition
               which cannot be switched off by normal means.
               Front End Board:  Intermittent contact in the
               solder joints of certain surface mount trim
               resistors, may lead to such problems as loss
               of blood pressure wave form, inability to zero
               the blood pressure channel, loss or inaccuracy
               of the shuttle transducer gain, no ECG wave
               form, no pacer detection, inaccuracy of the
               external pressure output or an analog to
               digital (A/D) converter failure.
               Solenoid Driver Board:  A solder flux left
               beneath the integrated circuit, created the
               possibility of a conductive path which can
               result in a short circuit of the board.

DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       Approximately 500 units.
REASON         The relay controlling the CO2 flow can
