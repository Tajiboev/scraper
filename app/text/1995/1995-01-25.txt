_______________
PRODUCTS       Canned Mud Skipper and Canned Mushrooms (94-725-953).
CHARGES        Adulterated - One of the articles (the mushrooms) contains
               an added poisonous and deleterious substance, staphylococcal
               enterotoxin, which may render it injurious to health; and
               both of the articles (the mushrooms and the mud skipper)
               have been prepared and packed under conditions whereby they
               may have been rendered injurious to health.  Misbranded -
               The labeling of one of the articles (the mushrooms) is false
               and misleading because it represents and suggests that the
               article was grown and packed in Taiwan, and that the article
               is sliced mushrooms, which is contrary to fact.

               infection due to a broad spectrum of bacterial, fungal, and
               viral disease-producing agents) (94-682-477).
CHARGES        New drug - No approved new drug applications are in effect
               for the articles.  Adulterated - The methods used in, and
               the facilities and controls used for, the articles'
               manufacture, processing, packing, and holding do not conform
               to and are not operated and administered in conformity with
               current good manufacturing practice.  Misbranded - The
               articles fail to bear adequate directions for use, since
               they are "new drugs" for which adequate directions cannot be
               written.
