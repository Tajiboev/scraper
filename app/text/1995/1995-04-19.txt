MANUFACTURER   Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan 
RECALLED BY    Olympus America Inc., Lake Success, New York, by letters of
               February 8, 1995 and March 27, 1995.  Firm-initiated recall
               ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide, Canada, South American, Central America.
QUANTITY       Approximately 422 units are affected by this recall.
REASON         The video endoscopes are more susceptible to surges of
               electrical current due to a manufacturing defect in the
               charged coupled device (CCD) chip which will cause the video
               endoscopes to lose their images.
