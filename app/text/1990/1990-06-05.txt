Distribution:     Nationwide and international. 
Quantity:         384 packages of connectors (three right-angle and four
                  straight connectors per package) were distributed.
Reason:           Some of the right angle connectors are partially or 
                  completely blocked by plastic (flash) left from the 
                  molding process.  Obstruction of the right angle may cause
                  reduction or loss of proper fluid flow.
