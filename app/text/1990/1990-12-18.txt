Reason:           The infusion pump generates electronic noise, i.e. static 
                  electricity, during operation which may create artifacts
                  on patient monitoring devices, such as ECG, EMG and EEG 
                  machines.  These artifacts, if not recognized as such, may
                  lead to an erroneous interpretation of the readings from
                  the patient monitoring.
