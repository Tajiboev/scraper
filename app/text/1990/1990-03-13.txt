                  connects the needle to the butterfly grips.

Reason:           The joint between the tubing and the luer connector 
                  may leak and could possibly separate.

                  ongoing.
Distribution:     Nationwide. 
Quantity:         107,160 units were distributed; firm estimates 5,000 -

Reason:           The device has been marketed without an approved premarket
