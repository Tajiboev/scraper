MANFACTURER
Guidant Corporation, Cardiac Pacemakers, St. Paul, Minnesota.
RECALLED BY
Manufacturer, by letter sent on December 5, 1998.  Firm-initiated
action is a field correction which is ongoing.  During the field
correction, the defibrillators are being reprogrammed.  The
returned or explant of the defibrillators has not been
requested. 
DISTRIBUTION
Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY
13,851 defibrillators.
REASON
A rare interaction of the device's internal timing sequences has
the potential to create a situation in which the defibrillators
stop delivering pacing therapy for up to 24 hours.  When this
situation occurs, the device resumes pacing at the next daily
battery measurement or whenever cardioversion/defibrillation
therapy is delivered, making all therapies available.  This
anomaly can recur.  Cardioversion/defibrillation therapy is
always available.
