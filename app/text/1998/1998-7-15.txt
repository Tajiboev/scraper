MANUFACTURER
Mer-Mar, Inc., Hesperia, California (PC Board); Harris Central
Application, Palm Bay, Florida (chip).
RECALLED BY
Newport Medical Instruments, Inc., (NMI) Costa Mesa, California,
by letter on March 5, 1998.  Firm-initiated field correction
ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION
Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY
61 ventilators were distributed.
REASON
A bad IC (chip) causes inadvertent System Reset, continually
during power-up, or randomly during operation, wherein (1) the  
ventilators cease operation (gas flow ceases and the exhalation
valve opens) for about 4 seconds, then restarts at values that
were set before the reset (except as follows), (2) the Sigh
Function defaults to off, (3) the Nebulizer defaults to off, (4)
the Inspiratory Minute Volume Alarm defaults to the 0-50 L. range
(an increase by a factor of 10 if originally set in the 1-5 L.
range), (5) Apnea Back-up Ventilation will likely commence for
foreign units (at 1.5 times the set rate, but with a minimum of
15 breaths/min and a maximum of 100 breaths/min with previously
set tidal volumes and pressures), and (6) the low pressure alarm
will likely reset, leading to nuisance alarms.
