RECALLED BY
Manufacturer.  FDA approved the firm's corrective action plan on

DISTRIBUTION
Nationwide.
QUANTITY
1,086 units were distributed.
REASON
The diagnostic X-ray devices were found defective under the 
Federal performance standard for diagnostic X-ray systems and 
their major components. The defect occurs when the system is 
driven to maximum EER and the source to image receptor distance 
(SID) is moved to a shorter distance while continuing to make 
exposures.  In this manner of operation, the output may exceed 10 
R/min because the software will not update the output until the 
exposure control is released.  Therefore, the system is in 
violation of the EER limits of the standard (21 CFR 1020.32(d) 
and (e)).
