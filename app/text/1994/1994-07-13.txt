PRODUCTS       Various articles of drug, in various sizes and types of 
               containers (regardless of identification as to lot, batch,
               part, or control number) variously labeled or unlabeled,
               which are determined to have originated outside the State of
               Texas, and which are identified as, or otherwise determined
               to consist of, one or more of the following:  Albuterol

               Cromolyn Sodium, Desipramine Hydrochloride, Indomethacin,
               Ipratropium Bromide, Isoetharine Hydrochloride, Ketoprofen,
               Metaproterenol Sulfate, Methotrexate, Methoxsalen, Morphine

               Tetracycline, and Vancomycin Hydrochloride, are antibiotics
               that are not certified as required and they are not exempt
               from such certification requirements because they are not
               the subject of an approved antibiotic drug application or an
               approved abbreviated antibiotic drug application. The
               remaining articles' labeling fails to bear adequate
               directions for use.  The articles are intended for
               processing, repacking, or use in the manufacture of other
               drugs, or are sold as prescription chemicals for use by
               registered pharmacists in compounding prescriptions or for
               dispensing upon prescriptions, but these articles are not
               exempt because the drug products that result from use of the
               articles are new drugs and no new drug applications have
               been approved for any of these drugs as required.
