MANUFACTURER   Coulter Corporation, Instruments Group, Hialeah, Florida.
RECALLED BY    Coulter Corporation, Miami, Florida, by letter beginning May
               26, 1992.  Firm-initiated recall ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       Approximately 315 machines remain uncorrected.
REASON         Software errors.  When manually entering sample
               identification numbers, two conditions can occur which may
               result in sample mis-identification.  During sample
               analysis, if a flowcell block or initial count failure is
               detected, a purge cycle is performed.  When this occurs the
               identification of a specimen awaiting analysis may be lost.

_______________
PRODUCT        Plasma products intended for the manufacture of in-vitro 
               diagnostic products and labeled, in part, Source Plasma
               (Human), Human Plasma, and Plasmaflasche (94-661-765/9).
CHARGE         Adulterated - The methods used in, and the facilities and
               controls used for, the articles' manufacture, packing, and
               storage are not in conformity with good manufacturing
               practice requirements for blood products.  Misbranded - the
               labeling for the product "Source Plasma (Human)" is false
               and misleading because it implies that the products are
               licensed and are suitable for use in manufacturing when, in
               fact, the products are not licensed and not suitable for
               further manufacturing; labeling for the product labeled as
               "Human Plasma" is false and misleading because it does not
               clearly distinguish such articles from "Plasma," a product
               subject to licensure under the PHS Act, and suitable for
               transfusion; and labeling for products lacking
               identification of the collecting establishment is false and
               misleading because labeling has been added which falsely
               implies that the product is suitable for further
               manufacture.  The labels (Plasmaflasche) do not bear the
               name and location of the manufacturer; and information
               required to appear on the label or labeling of the products
               other than those labeled as "Source Plasma (Human," is not
               prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness and in
               such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood
               by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of
               purchase and use in that the products fail to bear the
               proper article name and other required information.
LOCATION       Abbott Laboratories Diagnostic Division, Abbott Park,
               Illinois.
