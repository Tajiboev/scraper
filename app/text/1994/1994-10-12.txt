PRODUCT        Abbott IMx Stat CK-MB Assay System, a microparticle enzyme
               immunoassay for the quantitative measurement of the MB
               isoenzyme of creatine kinase in human serum or plasma to
               assist in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. 
               Recall #Z-001-5.
CODE           All lots.
MANUFACTURER   Abbott Laboratories, Inc., Abbott Park, Illinois.
RECALLED BY    Manufacturer, by telephone beginning August 15, 1994, and by
               fax to international accounts August 13, 1994.  Firm-
               initiated recall ongoing.
