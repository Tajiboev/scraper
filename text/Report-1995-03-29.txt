               recall ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       656 units were distributed.

               approximately 160 ms after the peak of the R wave of the
               electrocardiogram.  This delay may cause the device to
               discharge during the T wave period of the ECG complex which
               could produce a life-threatening ventricular fibrillation.
