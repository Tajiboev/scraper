RECALL NUMBER, PRODUCT AND CODE:
F-583-1, Badia Brand Paprika, 2 0z plastic bottles, with a 
red/green/white /black label printed in part:  "**Badia Spices, Inc., 
Miami, FL 33172-6497***" The lot number and date is printed on top of the 
bottle cap as follows: "Lot: 120400 EXP 12/005" or "EXP 01/2006 LOT 
120400". Initially a market withdrawal, the firm action is now a recall 
because of a positive FDA sample of bulk product used to repack various 
sizes (sample # 120400 collected on 2/7/01). This includes 1 oz. 
cellophane packs and 16 oz bottles, one gallon (4.5 lb) and 20 lb plastic
