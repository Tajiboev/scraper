MANUFACTURER   Becton Dickinson Vacutainer Systems, Plymouth, England.
RECALLED BY    Becton Dickinson Vacutainer Systems, Franklin Lakes, New
               Jersey (responsible firm), by letter July 15, 1994.  Firm-
               initiated recall complete.
DISTRIBUTION   California, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New
               Jersey, Oklahoma, and Texas.
QUANTITY       33,600 units were distributed; firm estimates none remains
               on the market.
REASON         Shelf cartons were labeled with the incorrect expiration
               date of September 15, 1994 rather than the correct date of
               February 15, 1994.  The use of the collection tube after the
               correct expiration could result in a loss of vacuum which
               would result in less than expected volume of blood
               collection and a higher anticoagulant blood ratio.
