               below "Adapter Sleeve", "Interlocking Track"
               or "both."  "Adapter Sleeve" means that a
               problem with the adapter sleeve needs to be
               corrected and "Interlocking Track" means that
               a problem with interlocking track needs to be
               corrected.  Devices identified by serial
               numbers in the first two columns have only one
               of the two problems and devices with serial
               numbers in the third column are affected by
               both problems.
