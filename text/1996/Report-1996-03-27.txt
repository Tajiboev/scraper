REASON         A REM transformer component defect. A
               potential exists that may allow the REM alarm
               indicator light to remain green, indicating
               proper attachment of the return electrode,
               when incomplete patient contact actually
               exists.  When this occurs, the REM system will
               not alarm or disable the generator.
