MANUFACTURER   Medtronic Med Rel, Inc., Humacao, Puerto Rico.
RECALLED BY    Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, by
               device retrieval plan dated March 10, 1997. 
               Firm-initiated recall ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide.
QUANTITY       2,358 units were distributed.
REASON         The device was distributed with
               out-of-specification connector header blocks
               resulting in device failure due to setscrew
               problems.

_______________
PRODUCT        Various size colored "TAMPS" for osteochondral
               Autograft (5mm, 6mm, 7mm, 8mm, 9mm and 10mm),
               Catalog numbers AR-1985-05 through AR-1985-10. 
               Recall #Z-442-7.
CODE           All codes.
MANUFACTURER   Arthrex, Inc., Naples, Florida.
RECALLED BY    Manufacturer, by letter on February 14, 1997. 
               Firm-initiated recall ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide.
QUANTITY       455 units were distributed.
REASON         There is a potential for the pin in the tamps
               to become dislodged and fall out.  If the pin
               were to fall out in surgery, it may be hard to
               retrieve because of its small size.
