               Ken, Japan.
  RECALLED BY  Nihon Kohden American, Inc., Irvine,
                 California, by telephone followed by letter on
                 August 12, 1996.  Firm-initiated recall
                 ongoing.
  DISTRIBUTION Nationwide and Canada.
  QUANTITY     134 units were distributed.
  REASON       If the battery is used beyond the recommended
                 life cycle, the battery may develop an
                 internal short circuit, thereby creating an
                 excessive current flow in the charging circuit
                 of the defibrillator which could render the
                 defibrillator inoperable until appropriate
                 repairs can be made.
