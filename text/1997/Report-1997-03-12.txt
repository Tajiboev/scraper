               applied to the monitoring electrodes and a
               chemical reaction is generated with EEG paste,
               which can discolor the patient's skin when the
               electrodes are placed on the patient skin.

               unexpected stop in table motion during certain
               low velocity Continuous Volume Studies (CVS),
               resulting in unnecessary x-ray radiation

               may interpret as a warning, causing the
               computer to display erroneous data for the
               image.
