Distribution:     Nationwide and international. 
Quantity:         99 units were distributed.
Reason:           User misalignment during set-up may possibly cause the

Reason:           A portion of the stirrers were not magnetized, which if

Quantity:         26 units were distributed; firm estimates none remains

Reason:           The calibrator components are not performing to labeling
                  specifications due to a loss in reconstituted stability.
                  The stability loss can be attributed to the effect of 
                  lyophilization on the human serum raw materials used in 
                  the product.
