MANUFACTURER   Panlmatic Company, Elk Grove Village, Illinois.

               market.  These affected units were distributed between May
               1985 and September 1987.
REASON         There is a potential for electrical shock if the wiring were

                                    -6-QUANTITY       416 pacers were distributed domestically.  Of those, 284
               were implanted and 132 were recovered (per final report).  A
               total of 574 pacers were distributed internationally and all
               were implanted.
REASON         An intended future safety feature included in the hybrid
               circuitry of the present device design can be spontaneously
               activated in some units, causing the device to act as an
               asynchronous single-chamber pacer.  The likely result of
               such an event would be that the pacer would revert to an 80
               pulses per minute (ppm) mode, which may not be a
               satisfactory default if the mode persists.
