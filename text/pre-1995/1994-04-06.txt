UPDATE         The February 9th Enforcement Report identified Wheaton
               Tubing Products ("Wheaton") as the manufacturer of recalled
               sterile glass vials for use with diluents and allergenic
               extracts (Recall #B-140/141-4).  Although the glass vials, a
               component of the final product, were supplied by Wheaton,
               the manufacturer is Allergy Laboratories, Inc.  The
               Enforcement should have identified Allergy Laboratories,
               Inc. as both the recalling and manufacturing firm of the
               final distributed product.

               sterile tubing sets.  The cracks result from excessive
               brittleness of the high-impact polystyrene after gamma
               irradiation, therefore compromising the sterility of the
               tubing product inside the package.
