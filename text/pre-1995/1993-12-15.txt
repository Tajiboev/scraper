_______________
PRODUCT        Eagle Patient Monitor, designed to monitor a fixed set of
               parameters including ECG, two invasive blood pressures, non-
               invasive blood pressure, impedance respiration, Sp02, and
               temperature.  Safety Alert #N-001-4.
CODE           All serial numbers.
MANUFACTURER   Marquette Electronics, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
ALERTED BY     Manufacturer, by letter May 3, 1993.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       1,379 units were distributed.
REASON         The display of inaccurate pulse oximetry values by the
               device has been linked to the presence of low signal
               strength or artifacts due to patient motion during signal
               analysis.  This has resulted in the display of erroneously
               low or unstable values.

REASON         The pacers may fail without warning, and exhibit a sudden no
               output condition due to loss of hermeticity as a result of
               cracked ceramic feedthrough assemblies.

CHARGES        Adulterated - Pineapple concentrate has been substituted in
               part for orange juice concentrate.  Misbranded - The label
               represents and suggests that the product is frozen
               concentrated orange juice, which representation and
               suggestion is false and misleading because the product
               consists in part of pineapple juice concentrate.  The label
               represents and suggests that the product is frozen
               concentrated orange juice, a food for which a definition and
               standard of identity has been prescribed, and the article
               fails to conform to that standard because it contains
               pineapple concentrate, an ingredient not permitted by the
               standard.

CHARGES        Adulterated - Pineapple juice has been substituted in part 
               for orange juice.  Misbranded - The label represents and
               suggests that the product is 100 percent pure orange juice
               from concentrate, which representation and suggestion is
               false and misleading because the product consists in part of
               pineapple juice solids.  The label represents and suggests
               that the product is orange juice from concentrate, a food
               for which a definition and standard of identity has been
               prescribed, and the article fails to conform to such
               definition and standard because it contains pineapple juice

_______________
PRODUCT        Various articles of food and porcelain ware (93-449-929).
CHARGES        Adulterated - One lot of lemon juice ginger and two lots of
               preserved plum contain cyclamate, a food additive which is
               unsafe because its presence in the foods is not in
               conformity with any regulation or exemption.  One lot of
               sweetened wintermelon contains filth, namely live and dead
               insects.  Two lots of red beans have been held under
               insanitary conditions whereby they may have become
               contaminated with rodent filth.  Articles of porcelain ware
               contain food additives, lead (spoons and bowl) and cadmium
               (bowl), which are unsafe because their use or intended use
               are not in conformity with a regulation.  Misbranded - The
               labeling of the lot of sweetened wintermelon is false and
               misleading since it fails to reveal that the product
               contains sulfites.  The labeling of two lots of red beans
               and the lot of sweetened wintermelon fails to declare
               (1) the place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or
               distributor; (2) an accurate statement of the quantity of
               contents in terms of weight, measure or numerical count; and
               (3) the common or usual name of the food.  The lot of lemon
               juice ginger, two lots of preserved plum, and the lot of
               sweetened wintermelon are fabricated from two or more
               ingredients and their labels fail to bear the common or
               usual name of each such ingredient.  The lot of lemon juice
               ginger and two lots of preserved plum contain saccharin and
               their labels fail to bear the required warning statement.

PRODUCT        Ear candles, components, and brochures (93-671-958).
CHARGES        Adulterated - The article is a class III medical device for
               which no approved premarket approval application is in
               effect; and, the methods used in, and the facilities and
               controls used for, its manufacture, packing, and storage are
               not in conformity with current good manufacturing practice. 
               Misbranded - The article's labeling represents and suggests
               that it is adequate and effective for reducing ear wax,
               fever, and infections associated with a ruptured ear drum,
               and that it may be used as a replacement for surgical tubes
               inserted in the ear, which representations and suggestions

                                   -10-               are contrary to fact.  The article's labeling fails to bear
               adequate directions for use for the purposes for which it is
               intended.  The article is dangerous to health when used in
               the manner recommended and suggested in the labeling
               Attachment too large to be entirely displayed.
