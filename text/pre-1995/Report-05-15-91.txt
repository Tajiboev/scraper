Manufacturer:     McGaw of Puerto Rico, Inc., Sabana Grande,

Recalled by:      McGaw, Inc., Irvine, California, by letter February 13, 
                  1991.  Firm-initiated recall ongoing. 
Distribution:     Nationwide and Canada.
Quantity:         7,221,335 units were distributed. 
Reason:           Product uses a piggyback feature in which the rubber
                  check back valve may become tilted, allowing back flow
                  during a secondary (piggyback) infusion.

                  600 packages of Dual Pack and Tri-Level controls

Reason:           The product labeling for assay values and expected ranges
