                  probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative

Recalled by:      Manufacturer, letter August 15, 1990.  Firm-initiated 
                  field correction ongoing. 
Distribution:     Nationwide. 
Quantity:         10,404 units were distributed.
Reason:           The susceptability of the pump to high levels of
                  electrostatic discharge (ESD) may cause the pump to reset 
                  from the operating mode to the pre-operation self test
                  check mode and shut-down pumping operation.  The pump may 
                  "freeze" in the operating mode and shut-down pumping
                  operation with or without activating an alarm.

                           test may result in slightly lower blood glucose
                           reading.

Reason:           A defect in the molding of the rear housing can cause 
                  erroneous readings.  Squeezing the housing with as little 
                  as five pounds of pressure in a particular location can 
                  interfere with the instrument's transducer.
