ALERTED BY      Manufacturer, by letter June 16, 1992.
DISTRIBUTION    Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY        Undetermined.
REASON          The antigen standards used were found to have tested
                positive for antibodies to HIV.  Users are reminded to
                adhere to the warning precautions specified in the
                product labeling.

INJUNCTION:
               
PRODUCT         Sandwiches (93-689-981).
CHARGE          The complaint was filed to enjoin defendants from the
                preparation and holding for sale of sandwiches after
                the components of such sandwiches have been shipped in
                interstate commerce, which preparation and holding
                resulted in the sandwiches becoming adulterated, in
                that they contained Listeria monocytogenes, a
                poisonous or deleterious   substance which may render
                the food injurious to health, and in that the
                sandwiches have been prepared, packed or held  under
                insanitary conditions whereby they may have become
                contaminated with filth or whereby they may have been
                rendered injurious to health.

DEFENDANTS      Finest Foods, Inc., doing business as Mrs. Drake's
                Sandwiches, a corporation, and James W. Ganus, James
                W. Ganus, Jr., Robert W. Ganus, and Ronald P.
                Blanchard, individuals, New Orleans, Louisiana.
FILED           March 5, 1993; U.S. District Court for the Eastern
                District of   Louisiana; Civil #93-0746; INJ 1317.

SEIZURES:
               
PRODUCT         Canned fruit cocktail, canned pears, and canned
                peaches(92-271-336).
CHARGE          Adulterated - The canned peaches consisted in part of
                a filthy substance because they contained Geotrichum
                mold.  Misbranded - All of the articles had product
                labels that expressed net quantity of contents in
                terms of fluid measure rather than the required
                avoirdupois pound and ounce.  In addition, the labels
                of the canned fruit cocktail and canned pears failed
                to include the packing medium as part of the name as
                required; the canned fruit cocktail contained only
                two of the five ingredients required by the standard;
                and, the quality of the canned peaches and canned
                pears fell below identified standards of quality
                because the peaches contained excess pieces of pit and
                the pears did not conform to the uniformity of size
                requirement and neither product bore the required
                label statement that they fell below the  standards.
