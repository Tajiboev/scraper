CODE           Not applicable.
MANUFACTURER   Aerometrics, Inc., Sunnyvale, California.
RECALLED BY    Manufacturer.  FDA approved the firm's corrective action
               plan December 16, 1992.  Firm-initiated field correction
               complete.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide.
QUANTITY       41 units.
REASON         Various models failed to have adequate protective housings
               (laser beam enclosures), labels, and operating
               instructions. 
_______________
PRODUCT        Version UPS V9.11 Software for Nucletron Planning System
               (NPS), used with the MicroSelectron High Dose Rate
               Afterloading System (MHDR).  Recall #Z-111-4.
CODE           All NPS units and All MHDR units.

MANUFACTURER   Nucletron B.V., Waargelder 1, The Netherlands.
RECALLED BY    Nucletron Corporation, Columbia, Maryland, by Technical
               Notes dated April 5, 1991.  Firm-initiated field
               correction complete.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Mexico,
               Venezuela, West Indies.
QUANTITY       231 NPS units and 242 MHDR units.
REASON         The device contains inadequate directions for use.  The
               firm's upgrade of the MHDR software to  Version 3.31
               allowed the user to choose either 2.5 mm or 5.0 mm as the
               unit step length in defining the location of the
               radioactive source.  The NPS V9.11 software, however,
               while  allowing the user to employ either step length in
               the planning session, did not write the  manually entered
               step length to the program card.  Instead, the step length
               value in the "customizing file" would be transferred via
               program card to the MHDR.  If the user failed to update
               the "Separation of Dwell Positions" parameter in the NPS
               "customizing file," the positioning of the radioactive
               source could be grossly in error.  The lack of adequate 
               directions for use of the NPS could result in
               misadministration of dosage to the patient.

MANUFACTURER   Mallinckrodt Medical TPI, Inc., Irvine, California.
RECALLED BY    Manufacturer, by letter dated August 9, 1993.  Firm-
               initiated recall ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide, Mexico, Taiwan, Australia, Puerto Rico,
               Germany.
QUANTITY       2,225 units were distributed; firm estimates 50 units
               remain on the market.
REASON         Inflation system may leak, thereby compromising the
               patient breathing circuit.  This leak may result in a
               deflation of the cuff that holds the tracheostomy tube in
               place and prevents air from bypassing the tracheostomy
               tube.

DISTRIBUTION   Undetermined.

               use with the EMIT 2000 Digoxin Assay.  Recall #Z-094-4.
CODE           Lot numbers:  F1, Sublots F1A and F1B, Lot F2.
MANUFACTURER   Syva Company, San Jose, California.
RECALLED BY    Manufacturer, by letter dated November 9, 1993.  Firm-
               initiated recall ongoing.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY       Firm estimated 1,619 kits were in commerce as of October
               26, 1993.
REASON         Some of the calibrators of the calibration kit were
               contaminated with microbials.

PRODUCT        Software for Nucletron Planning System (NPS) and the
               MicroSelectron High Dose Rate Afterloading System (MHDR):
               (a) Software for NPS (Version 9.11);
               (b) Software for MHDR (Version 3.2).  Recall #Z-109/110-4.
CODE           All Nucletron Planning Systems.
MANUFACTURER   Nucletron B.V., Waardgelder 1, The Netherlands.
RECALLED BY    Nucletron Corporation, Columbia, Maryland, by Technical
               Notes issued in August 1990.  Firm-initiated field
               correction complete.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide and South America.
QUANTITY       231 NPS units and 242 MHDR units.
REASON         Products contain inadequate directions for use.  When a
               new radioactive source is installed in the MHDR, the user
               must update the value of the source activity in the NPS
               "customizing file" with the same value that is entered
               into the MHDR control unit.  If this is not done, then the
               NPS treatment planning session exposure times will be
               based on a different source activity than that in the
               MHDR.  In this case, the MHDR software will adjust
               exposure times in an attempt to compensate for the
               perceived differences in activity values.  Furthermore,
               users may be mislead to believe that the "manually
               specified activity" allowed in the NPS planning session,
               is the activity value which will 
               be read by the MHDR when the planning session parameters
               are transferred via program card.  This is not true; the
               NPS "customizing file" activity will be transferred to the
               MHDR via program card regardless of the manually entered
               value.  
               This "customizing file" value can only be changed by
               updating the "customizing file."

DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide.
QUANTITY       (a) 27 single-unit boxes; (b) 36 single-unit boxes were
               distributed.
REASON         The Calcium Chloride was misformulated and possibly
               contaminated.  The Calcium Chloride was then used to
               establish the clotting time range for CLOTtrac Low Range
