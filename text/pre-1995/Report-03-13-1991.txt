Reason:           Some of the white Rate-Clip regulators, when in the closed

                  When the Rate-Minder IV Volumetric controller is on, the
                  device will alarm "check IV set" but IV fluid may continue
                  to flow.  When the device is off, uncontrolled drops may
                  flow and no alarm will sound.  When the sets are used 
                  outside the device as gravity sets, uncontrolled drops may
                  also occur.
