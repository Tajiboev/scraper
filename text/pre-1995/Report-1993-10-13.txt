                   Theratronics International, Ltd., 2833 Trinity Mills Road,
                   Carrollton, Texas.
ALERTED BY         Theratroncis International, Ltd., Kanata, Canada, by User
                   Bulletins CUB93-03, AUB 93-02 and SUB 93-01 dated May 5,
                   1993.
DISTRIBUTION       Nationwide and international.
QUANTITY           421 units.
REASON             Potential for injury to operator's and patient's fingers if
                   hands are not kept clear of the treatment table mechanisms
                   while table movement is in progress.

PRODUCT            MicroSelectron High Dose Rate Treatment Tube used with
                   Nucletron Micro Selectron-HDR Remote Afterloading Systems,
                   used for connecting needles and flexible implants.
                   Safety Alert #N-080-3.
CODE               All units.
MANUFACTURER       Nucletron BV, Waardgelder 1, The Netherlands.
RECALLED BY        Nucletron Corporation, Columbia, Maryland, by sending
                   technical notes to users on June 10, 1991.
DISTRIBUTION       Nationwide, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Columbia, Mexico,
                   Venezuela, West Indies.
QUANTITY           242 high dose rate units.

                                       -14-REASON             Under certain conditions, less than accurate performance
                   could prevail.  Prior to using the Source Position
                   Simulator for depth measurements of the x-ray catheter for
                   radiographs of the implant area, users should insure that
                   the treatment tubes and implant applicators are draped in a
                   curved rather than straight fashion in order to achieve
                   appropriate connection to the microSelectron-HRD.  This
                   method will insure the highest accuracy of the system and
                   the ability to accurately position the source.
