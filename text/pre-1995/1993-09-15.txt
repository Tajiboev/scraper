PRODUCT        Various articles of device for use in the practice
of
               obstetrics and gynecology, and device components
used to
               make them (93-544-578).
CHARGES        Adulterated - Some of the articles are class III
devices
               that lack approved premarket approval applications. 
The
               methods used in, and the facilities and controls
used for,
               all of the articles' manufacture, packing, and
storage are
               not in conformity with current good manufacturing
practice
               requirements.  Misbranded - Labeling for all of the
articles
               represents and suggests that the devices are
sterile, which
               representations and suggestions are false and
misleading or
               otherwise contrary to fact.  The articles' labeling
lacks
               adequate directions for use for the purposes for
which the
               devices are intended because adequate directions
cannot be
               written for devices labeled as sterile which have
not been
               sterilized.  The articles are misbranded in that
they are
               dangerous to health when used in the manner
prescribed,
               recommended, or suggested in their labeling.  All of
the
               articles were manufactured, prepared, propagated,
compounded
               or processed in an establishment not duly
registered, and
               were not included in a required list.  A notice or
other
               information for some of the articles was not
