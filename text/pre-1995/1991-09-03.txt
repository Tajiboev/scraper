Charge:           The articles are drugs, which may not be introduced or
                  delivered for introduction into interstate commerce since 
                  they are new drugs and no approvals of applications are 
                  in effect for such drugs; their labeling falsely represents 
                  and suggests that the article is safe and effective for 
                  their intended use in the prevention or treatment of disease
                  conditions, which representation and suggestions are contrary 
                  to fact; and their labeling fails to bear adequate directions 
                  for use, and they are not exempt from such requirement under
                  21 CFR 201.115 since the articles are unapproved "new drugs".
