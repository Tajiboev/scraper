Reason:           Pacemakers contain a chip capacitor that is not performing
                  to specification.  The generator may exhibit early and rapid
                  battery depletion with a corresponding reduction in pulse
                  amplitude.  In addition, the potential exists for an
                  immediate "no output" condition upon failure of the
                  capacitor.

Distribution:     Alabama, Colorado.
Quantity:         8 units.
Reason:           Noncompliance with the performance standards for
                  light-emitting products in that:  (1) the Weld-bead
                  Profiling Sensors lacked a remote interlock connector;
                  (2) none of the systems incorporated an emission indicator
                  which turns on sufficiently prior to emission of laser
                  radiation to allow appropriate action to avoid exposure;
                  (3) Model BP002 does not incorporate a beam attenuator;
                  (4) the user instructions lacked the adequate information;
                  (5) and the firm failed to establish and maintain required
                  records or to submit required reports.
