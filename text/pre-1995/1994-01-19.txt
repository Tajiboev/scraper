               the antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1
               (anti-HIV-1) by Enyme Immunoassay (EIA) or tested non-

MANUFACTURER   Accelerator Systems, International, Milpitas, California.
RECALLED BY    Manufacturer, by telephone May 27, 1993.  Firm-initiated
               recall complete.
DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide.
QUANTITY       29 units.
REASON         The radiation units are missing steel straps which allowed
               lead counterweights to shift and gantry to become
               unbalanced, causing a 180 degree rotation to unit's most
               stable position.  By not having steel straps in place, the
               lead sheets could shift and stress the retaining bolts until
               they failed, causing crushing injury to the patient.

               Enforcement Report as a Class III recall has been
               reclassified as Class II because of lack of a Section 510(k)
               premarket notification.  The reason for recall should read: 
               Devices were not manufactured in accordance with device good
               manufacturing practices requirements, and there was no
               premarket notification (Section 510(k)) clearance prior to
