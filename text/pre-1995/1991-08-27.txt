                  is undetermined.

Reason:           There is a probability that dummy radioactive sources 
                  could be introduced into the column.  This could lead 
                  to undertreatment of patients or possible unintended

Seizure Actions Filed:

Product:          Herbal No. 7.  (91-581-679).
Charge:           The article is a drug, which may not be introduced or 
                  delivered for introduction into interstate commerce 
                  since it is a new drug and no approval of an application
                  is in effect for such drug; its labeling falsely represents 
                  and suggests that the article is safe and effective for use 
                  in the prevention or treatment of disease conditions, which 
                  representations and suggestions are contrary to fact; and 
                  its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use, 
                  and it is not exempt from such requirement since the
                  article is an unapproved new drug.
