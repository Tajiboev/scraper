               and alarm go off.  However, ventilator failure may cause
               apnea or hypoventilation leading to permanent severe
               neurologic injury.

               concerning the gas contents of the cylinder.  The cylinders
               are labeled to contain 5% CO2 with the balance Nitrogen, but

SEIZURES:

_______________
PRODUCT        Maple Syrup, Sorghum, and Honey (94-736-103).
CHARGES        Adulterated  - A sweetener resembling corn syrup has been 
               substituted wholly or in part for maple syrup, honey, and
               sorghum syrup.  Misbranded - The articles' labeling is false
               and misleading because it represents and suggests that the
               food consists entirely of maple syrup, honey, or sorghum
               syrup, which representations and suggestions are contrary to
               fact; the articles are offered for sale under the name of
               another food, namely pure maple syrup, honey, and sorghum
               syrup; the food purports to be and is represented as maple
               syrup (58 and 18 case lots) and sorghum syrup (30 and 10
               case lots of sorghum syrup), foods for which definitions and
               standards of identity have been prescribed by regulation,
               but the articles fail to meet that standard in that the
               articles consist wholly or in large part of a sweetener
               resembling corn syrup.
LOCATION       Eagle Creek Farms, Marysville and Arlington, Washington.
