SUBJECT        Changes in format for the FDA Enforcement Report.
               To conserve space, and improve the ease of use, it has become    
               necessary to adjust the arrangement of headings and text.        
               Editions will no longer include titles for categories not used   
               along with the word "none."  Instead, categories not needed for  
               the week's listings will be omitted.  Other changes include the  
               addition of two new categories, Indictments and Informations,    
               and the placement of Class I, II, and III descriptions under     
               the Recall definition on the front cover page.
