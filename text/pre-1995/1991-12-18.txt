Product:          Breaded Shrimp (91-543-709).
Charge:           Misbranded - Product is represented as a food for
                  which a definition and standard of identity has been
                  prescribed by regulation and it does not conform to such
                  definition and standard since the product contains less
                  than 50 percent shrimp because excess breading material
                  has been substituted in part for shrimp, and the label
                  does not bear the common or usual names of optional
                  ingredients present.
