CHARGES        Adulterated - Valuable constituents, namely Vitamin C and
               Riboflavin, have been partly omitted from the article.
               Misbranded - The article's labeling is false and misleading
               because it represents and suggests that the article provides
               30 percent of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of
               Vitamin C and 33 percent of the U.S. RDA of Riboflavin per
               serving; whereas, the article provides from 4.07 to 8.2
               percent of the U.S. RDA of Vitamin C and from 16 to 16.6
               percent of the U.S. RDA of Riboflavin per serving; and the
               nutrition information, ingredients statement, and name and
               place of business of the distributor are not prominently
               placed on the label with such conspicuousness as to render
               them likely to be read by the ordinary individual under
               customary conditions of purchase and use because they do not
               appear together on the principal display panel or together
               without intervening material on the information panel, and
               they appear in a type size of less than 1/16-inch in height.

               packing, and storage are not in conformance with the current
