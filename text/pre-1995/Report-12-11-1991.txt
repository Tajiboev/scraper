                  Firm-initiated recall complete.
Distribution:     Nationwide.
Quantity:         56,513 units were distributed; firm estimates none

Reason:           The narrowing of the channel width of the pouchside flange 
                  has compromised the binding strength of the flange-to-flange
                  connection resulting in urine leakage.
