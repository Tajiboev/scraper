Defendant:        Alfred G. Maroun, and Maroun Brothers, Inc.,
                  Lawrence, Massachusetts.
Product:          Flour (89-568-124).
Charge:           On February 12, 1990, an indictment was returned
                  charging both Mr. Maroun and the corporation with
                  eight felony counts of adulterating food products in that
                  they consisted in whole or in part of a filthy substance,
                  and that they had been held under insanitary conditions
                  whereby they may have become contaminated with filth.  In
                  addition, Mr. Maroun and the corporation have twice before
                  been convicted of similar charges -- operating a dirty
                  warehouse.  The first violation was a misdemeanor conviction
                  and the second violation was a felony conviction.
Disposition:      On October 27, 1991, Mr. Maroun plead the corporation guilty
                  to the eight counts charged in the indictment, and plead
                  himself guilty to three of the charged counts.  On February

                  to four different professional wrestlers between November

                  condominium complex to facilitate the distribution of
                  steroids and controlled substances.  In addition, the jury
                  found that Zahorian's office-condominium, valued at
                  approximately $1.7 million, is subject to forfeiture to

                  of conviction for distributing anabolic steroids and
                  controlled substances, Zahorian was sentenced to 36 months
