UPDATE         The seizure of Ear Candles, which appeared in the December
               15, 1993 Enforcement Report was incomplete as reported. 
               This update is the complete text:

PRODUCT        Ear candles, components, and brochures (93-671-958).
CHARGES        Adulterated - The article is a class III medical device for
               which no approved premarket approval application is in
               effect; and, the methods used in, and the facilities and
               controls used for, its manufacture, packing, and storage are
               not in conformity with current good manufacturing practice. 
               Misbranded - The article's labeling represents and suggests
               that it is adequate and effective for reducing ear wax,
               fever, and infections associated with a ruptured ear drum,
               and that it may be used as a replacement for surgical tubes
               inserted in the ear, which representations and suggestions
               are contrary to fact.  The article's labeling fails to bear
               adequate directions for use for the purposes for which it is
               intended.  The article is dangerous to health when used in
               the manner recommended and suggested in the labeling.  The
               article was manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded,
               or processed in an establishment not duly registered and was
               not included in a required list; a notice or other required
               information was not provided as required prior to its
               introduction into interstate commerce.
