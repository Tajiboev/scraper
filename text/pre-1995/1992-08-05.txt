DISTRIBUTION   Nationwide.
QUANTITY       (a) 142 units; (b) 19 units; (c) 3 units; (d) 15 units were      
               distributed.
REASON         Some of these units were shipped with grade 5 bolts instead of   
               grade 8 bolts, which are used to secure the head, beamstopper    
               and counterweight to the arm, and also to secure the arm to the  
               tube shaft for rotational units.  These bolts are also used to   
               secure the head/neck assembly to the carriage assembly of        
               vertical units.  Use of incorrect bolt grade may compromise      
               safety to due to fatigue failure.
