                                     -14-

               labeled; some units were shipped without insert sheets; some     
               units' inner tamper-indicating seals did not fit properly and    
               therefore are prone to failure; label corners were coming off    
               bottles; and units were shipped without adequate quality         
               control/quality assurance release.
