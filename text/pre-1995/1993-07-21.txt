CRIMINAL INFORMATION:

_______________
AGAINST         Biopharmaceutics, Inc., Bellport, New York.
CHARGES         Biopharmaceutics pleaded guilty to a three-count felony
                Information.  The Information charged the firm with
                submitting false statements to the Food and Drug
                Administration in applications seeking approval to market
                various prescription drug products.  The firm admitted that
                in various applications submitted to the FDA in 1988 and
                1989, it knowingly submitted false information relating to
                its research and development in manufacturing three
                different prescription drugs.  The three drugs in question
                were Clindamycin Hydrochloride 150 mg. capsules, an
                antibiotic used in the treatment of serious infections;
                Carisoprodol with Aspirin tablets, a muscle relaxant and
                analgesic; and Chlorzoxazone 500 mg. tablets, a skeletal, 
                muscle relaxant.  The other two counts to which
                Biopharmaceutics pleaded guilty related to similar false
                statements made in support of the firm's other
                applications.  Biopharmaceutics was sentenced to pay a
                $350,000 criminal fine.
