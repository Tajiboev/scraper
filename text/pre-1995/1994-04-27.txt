               gloves, but as an advertisement for an antibiotic
               (Augmentin), which was promoted to doctors.

                                   -29-CHARGES        Adulterated - The articles are class III devices for which 
               no approved premarket approval applications are in effect. 
               Further, the methods used in, and the facilities and
               controls used for the articles' manufacture do not conform
               with good manufacturing practice requirements.  Misbranded -
               The articles' labeling represents and suggests that the
               devices are adequate and effective treatment for, among
               other things:  strengthening and building chest, back, arms
               and legs; tightening abdominals; etc., which representations
               and suggestions are false and misleading or otherwise
               contrary to fact because the devices are not adequate and
               effective for such purposes.  The articles' labels lack the
               name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or
               distributor.  Adequate directions for use for the purposes
               for which they are intended are also lacking from the
               articles' labels since adequate directions cannot be written
               for use of the devices by laymen.  The labels inadequately
               warn against their use in those pathological conditions or
               by children where their use may be dangerous to health, nor
               do the labels warn against unsafe dosage or methods of
               administration or application, in such manner and form, as
               are necessary for the protection of users.  The articles are
               dangerous to health when used in the manner or with the
               frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested
               in their labeling.  The articles were not manufactured in a
               duly registered establishment, nor were they included in a
               required list.

CHARGES        New Drug - The articles of drug are new drugs that are

               some of the articles of drug falls below that which they
               purport or are represented to possess; and, the class III
               device fails to have an approved premarket approval
               application in effect.  Misbranded Drugs and Device - The
               articles of drug bear labeling which is false and misleading
               because it represents and suggests that the liquid soap
               contains Resorcinol and the aqueous lotion contains
               Resorcinol and PCMX, which representations and suggestions
               are false, since they do not contain these ingredients.  The
               drugs also fail to bear labeling containing adequate
               directions for use for the purposes for which they are
               intended.  The required 90-day notice or other information
               with respect to the article of device has not been provided.
