               Enforcement Report should read:

               REASON:  Due to software anomalies, if the power is              
               interrupted, two conditions may occur upon restoration of power  
               which can cause the device to generate erroneous results.  One   
               result is the dilution of a specimen if the needle has pierced   
               the specimen, but has not retracted when the power is            
               interrupted.  The second is that calibration factors may be      
               lost and the instrument automatically reset to default           
               conditions.  Firm-initiated field correction complete.
